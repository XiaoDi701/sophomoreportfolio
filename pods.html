    <h1>Lost and Found</h1>
    <p>
        My teammate described the items she has lost—a pair of airpods, a very unremarkable pair of AirPods. Perhaps it was because they look exactly like millions of other AirPods, and because they had no distinguishing features, that she lost them. Although I’ve lost quite a few Apple products myself—probably including a dozen charging cables, some adapters, and a tablet that I lost but later found—I’ve never lost earphones (though I did wash them twice).

        Given that I already have six months of experience using p5.js, this assignment wasn't particularly challenging. However, I'm quite pleased with how I used translate(),rotate(), and boolean functions. I think the most important concept I revisited in this project was that when you want to rotate an object (but it's too far from the origin), you can translate the origin to the center around which you want to rotate. Additionally, to prevent a song from playing repeatedly, using a boolean function to set it to true under specific conditions is also a good idea.
