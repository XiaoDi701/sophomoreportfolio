    <h1>What I've Done</h1>

    <p>
        The concept behind this work is to artistically reveal the real harm that mental issues can bring to individuals; it is a piece with a strong educational intent.<br><br>
        As someone who has experienced (or is still experiencing) various mental health challenges, I’m often asked by people around me who are mentally healthy, “Do you think I have a mental illness?”
    </p>
    <p>
        From a scientific perspective, even mild depression or anxiety counts as a mental health issue. Out of responsibility and a mindset toward prevention, I sometimes respond, “Maybe.”<br><br>
        Mental health issues seem to have become a kind of trendy label—I've even encountered people who exaggerate or fabricate symptoms just to align with it.
    </p>
    <p>
        But when these people truly witness an acute episode—whether my own or someone else's—they often react with shock:<br>
        “Is that what mental illness is really like? That’s so deranged, terrifying, disgusting. I am not mentally ill! How could you assume I was?”
    </p>
    <p>
        Yet this is what mental illness has always been. When you experience moderate to severe mental issues, it’s not just about melancholic days or heartache.<br><br>
        You’ll face symptoms like stage 2 hypertension, vomiting, a feeling of imminent death, dizziness, asthma, and uncontrollable urges to self-harm or even suicidal impulses.<br><br>
        Mental illness is a real illness—it’s painful, it’s negative, and it’s something patients would give anything to shed for life.
    </p>
    <p>
        The primary concept woven into this work is <strong>“Do What I've Done”</strong>.<br><br>
        If you believe you have mental health issues, then come experience everything I’ve been through.<br><br>
        Do you think uncontrollable outbursts are trendy? Do you find unstoppable self-harm (a “fun fact”: during a panic attack, it’s nearly impossible to regain composure without self-harm) is something cool?<br><br>
        Do you see the ceaseless thoughts that cloud the mind as unique?
    </p>
    <p>
        You wouldn’t—because you don’t have a mental illness.<br><br>
        You are healthy and whole, the way mental health patients long to be.<br><br>
        Live well.
    </p>
